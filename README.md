# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand what variables make a kickstarter campaign for a play successful by analyzing kickstarter data and searching for patterns.

## Analysis and Challenges
To start this analysis a broader body of data about kickstarter campaigns had to be sorted for the relevant data. This data was sorted primarily by category and country, plays and the US, respectively. Then the data could be distinguished based on its outcome, whether or not it met its goal. T

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The dataset covers campaigns launched from 2010 to 2017, 1,369 campaigns for plays in total. Out of these, 61% successfully met their fundraising goal, 36% failed to meet their fundraising goal, and 3% were canceled. The majority of campaigns ran from 2014 to 2016, a 60% success rate held throughout this peak range. By organizing the data based on launch date, we can see that the late spring to early summer months present a higher likelihood of success. The increased likelihood of success during May and June can be seen in the graph below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis was conducted by starting with funding goals below $1,000 then breaking the entire range into increments of $5,000. From these increments,  we can see see that there were 1,005 campaigns with funding goals beneath $25,000, and 42 campaigns with funding goals above $25,000. Funding goals below $5,000 have a 73% success rate. Goals between $5,000 and $25,000 have a 53% success rate. And goals above $25,000 have a 28% success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The available data allowed for a substantial view of kickstarter campaign trends so it was well-suited to the purpose of this analysis. But the peak years for campaigns discussed in the analysis based on launch dates above suggests that there might be an issue with data collection for the years before 2014. Further, this analysis would have been enriched with information about the plays, such as genres and subject matters, as well as information about how successful campaigns were promoted. With this data we would have more ways of depicting success and failure.

## Results
This analysis suggests that launching kickstarter campaigns for plays in the late spring to early summer months with funding goals below $5,000 can maximize likelihood of success. This data suggests that funding goals seem to be a significant indicator of success.
